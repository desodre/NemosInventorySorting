# Nemo's Inventory Sorting

## Description

**Nemo's Inventory Sorting** is a _client-side_ mod that adds buttons to your inventory GUI.  
Sort your inventory, move all matching or all items, or drop everything at once, all with a single click.
It also improves quick moving with drag, split-stack, and single-item scroll transfer.

You can even filter and highlight items in containers by typing part of their name!
Quickly filter items by pressing **Ctrl + F** (or **Command + F** on macOS).    
You can change the key binding in the settings.

For more information and to see how to configure the components check the [wiki](https://wiki.nemonotfound.com/projects/minecraft-mods/nemos-inventory-sorting/general).

> **Tip:** If you're a dark mode enthusiast, you can use the built-in dark mode resource pack.

## ⚠ Disclaimer

This is a **client-only mod**, which means it can give you an advantage over other players.  
Using it on public servers *may* get you banned depending on the server’s rules.  
Use at your own risk — or check with the server admins beforehand.

## How to Use

### Sort, Drop or Move Items

Simply click the buttons or use your custom keybinds.
In the player inventory, clicking the buttons does not include the hotbar. To include it, use **Shift + Click** (or **Shift + keybind**).
Set `includeHotbarByDefault` to `true` in `config/nemos-inventory-sorting/general.json` to reverse this behavior. Shift will then exclude the hotbar.

### Quick Move Items

- **Shift + Drag**: quick-move hovered items
- **Shift + Right-Click/Drag**: quick-move half items
- **Scroll Up/Down**: move one item between inventory/container or inventory/hotbar
- **Shift + Scroll Up/Down**: also allow moving the last item from the source slot

The interactions can be toggled individually in `config/nemos-inventory-sorting/general.json` with `enableDragQuickMove`, `enableSplitQuickMove`, `enableScrollTransfer`, and `enableFavorites`.

> **Note:** Split and normal scroll actions keep at least one item in the source slot.

### Search Items
Click the search bar or press **Ctrl + [keybind]** (or **Command + [keybind]** on macOS), then start typing.    

#### Filter by (Custom) Name
- `Golden`      
- `Diamond Sword`     
- `Super Cool Sword`

#### Filter by Tooltip (Enchantment, Music Disc Song, Potions)
- `Sharpness`
- `Efficiency V`
- `Hyper Potions - Lava Chicken`
- `Lava Chicken`
- `Invisibility`

#### Filter by Item Tag
- `#minecraft:planks`
- `#nemos:planks`

#### Filter for multiple items
- `Stick,#minecraft:planks`

### Favorite Inventory Slots

Use **Alt + Right-Click** (or **Option + Right-Click** on macOS) to toggle a favorite in your player inventory or hotbar. A small gold star stays visible in the lower-right area of the slot, beside the stack count and above the durability bar. Dragging while holding the shortcut does not toggle other slots.

Favorites belong to **slots**, not individual items. Moving an item manually leaves the star on the original slot; empty favorite slots remain reserved. Favorites are shared across worlds and servers, just like the previous locked-slot configuration, and are not available in the creative inventory.

The mod's Sort, Move All, Move Same, Drop All, keybinds, drag quick-move, split quick-move and scroll transfer skip favorites as both sources and destinations. Sorting does not merge items into or out of a favorite stack. Normal vanilla interactions remain available, including mouse pickup, manual Shift-click, number-key swaps and dropping with Q/Ctrl+Q or outside the inventory. This protection applies to actions performed by this mod, not server events or other mods.

To disable favorites, add `"enableFavorites": false` to `config/nemos-inventory-sorting/general.json`. If omitted, the existing `enableSlotLocking` setting is used. Existing favorites are preserved in `locked-slots.json`; no migration or reset is needed.

When favorites are present, the mod uses explicit pickup clicks for bulk transfers so the server cannot route items into a favorite destination. Finish moving the item on your cursor before using these transfers or Sort. Quick transfer from a crafting/result slot moves one available result at a time and requires room for the entire result.

### Dark Mode

Enable the built-in **Nemo's Inventory Sorting Dark Mode** resource pack in Minecraft's resource pack menu.
